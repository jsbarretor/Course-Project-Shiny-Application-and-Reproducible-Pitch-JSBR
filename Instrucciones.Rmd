## Instructions 

This peer assessed assignment has two part: 

1. You will create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. 

2. You will use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.

## What does the application do?

The application allows you to emulate the toss of a coin, as many times **n** as you want, taking into consideration that it can be between 1 and 100 tosses. 

This is a completely **random process** so it can give different results in each run

## Code

Here is an example:

```{r 1, echo = TRUE}
run.1 <- sample(x = c("Head", "Tail"), # The possible values of the coin
                size = 10,  # 10 flips
                replace = TRUE) # Sampling with replacement
        
result <- toString(run.1)
result    
```
